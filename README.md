## Introduction

Just another Todo maker...

This is a simple application I made to help myself understand how to use PHP to work with text files for reading and writing. The end goal is to eventually make a simple CMS that enterprises can use to maintain and update a website, intended for mostly static, informational websites that may occasionally need update. Eliminating the need to contact a developer to simply update some text, while also avoiding all the extra backend resources generally associated with a CMS (API connections, Databases, etc.)

Please feel free to play around with it! 

## Development and Running Locally

You will need an environment able to run PHP (such as apache) and php installed.
